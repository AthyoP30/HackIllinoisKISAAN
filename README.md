This program accepts an agricultural contract in PDF format, and scans it for legal jargon and other important clauses which may be missed due to the large size of the contract document. The software then outputs those important clauses along with an AI generated summary of the same.

References The sample agricultural document - (https://farmlandinfo.org/sample_documents/sample-agricultural-land-purchase-agreement/) The OpenAI API link was used

Note: A sample agricultural contract can be found along with the code files in this github repo. Due to licensing issues related to Github, the API token may not work. in that case, please try modifying app.py and enter a new API token which can be easily generated from the OpenAI website
